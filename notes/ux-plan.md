## Transaction Types (from copilot money)

- **Regular** Money spent is considered a regular transaction. Copilot sorts these into categories so it’s easy to track your spending.
- **Internal** Money you move between accounts, such as paying a credit card bill, is considered an internal transfer. These transactions are excluded from your spending budgets.
- **Income** Money you earn is considered income. These transactions also aren’t included in your spending budgets.
